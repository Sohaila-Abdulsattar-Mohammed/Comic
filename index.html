    <p>
      This is you, an NYUAD student— and you're hungry. In search of a “good” meal, you go to the legendary Dining Hall 2, known affectionately as D2. In the mood for a meal, you decide to head there.
    </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          You finally reach D2 after an arduous, long hike. Finally, upon the
          doors of the grand institution, you pull on the door— surprisingly to
          no avail. You pull harder— still the doors don’t budge.

            You try and try again, the smell of delicious food so tantalizingly
            close yet still out of reach. Out of frustration, you kick the door—
            hard— just hoping the doors would open already. Little did you know
            that that was going to be a mistake.
