            <p>
              Meet Josh, an NYUAD student and survivor of the four-hour
              starvation block built into his class schedule. <br /><br />His
              destination: the legendary East Dining Hall, or as the locals call
              it... D2. <br /><br />The mission is clear. The path... long. The
              appetite... unstoppable.

          After an exhausting trek across campus, Josh finally arrives at D2.
          But as he grab the door handles and pulls... nothing. He tries
          again... still nothing. The doors of D2 stand unmoved, mocking his
          hunger.

            Josh's determination turns to desperation. He pulls, he yanks, he
            summons every bit of gym strength he swore he'd been building. In a
            final act of desperation, he kicks the door... a terrible choice.

            The air falls silent. A faint vibration hums through the frame.
            Then, two glowing eyes appear on the glass, glaring back at him. The
            D2 door has awakened! And it is furious.

          Metal groans. Hinges twist. Arms emerge from the doorway like steel
          vines. The once-innocent entrance now stands ready for battle. Josh
          clenches his fists, he'll do whatever it takes to get inside.
